# compiled-website

The Markless documentation site, served at `compiled.run/markless`. It is a real Markless app built
on the published `@markless/*` packages, so everything on it is doing what a reader's own app would
do.

## Run it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server
npm run build      # production build into .output/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

Pages live under `pages/markless/`, which is what puts them at `/markless/…`; `vite.config.ts` sets
the matching `base` and `nitro.baseURL`.

## Checks

```sh
npm run doctor     # environment and build sanity (from create-markless)
npm run witness    # builds must exist: serves .output, curls the routes, clicks a demo in Chrome
```

`npm run witness` needs a production build first (`npm run build`) and uses system Chrome through
`playwright-core`. It checks the routes answer, that the code blocks are really highlighted, that a
TSRX token shows its hover doc, and that the Counter island still resumes on a page whose first code
block sits above it. It writes screenshots into the markless repo's goal notes.

## Layout

- `pages/markless/**.mdx` — one file per page. Prose is markdown; interactive pieces are default
  exports of `.tsrx` files, imported at the top and used as top-level blocks.
- `components/demos/` — the demos. `Counter.tsrx` is the teaching component shown verbatim on the
  page; `CounterDemo.tsrx` wraps it in the playground frame, because MDX cannot nest components.
- `components/docs/Sidebar.tsrx`, `document.tsrx`, `nav.ts` — the chrome.
- `styles/global.css` — the look, copied from the markless repo's `docs/` app, plus the code-block
  palette and the hover-doc box.
- `tooling/` — build-time code. `highlight-mdx.ts` is a Vite plugin registered after `router()`;
  `highlight-code.ts` runs shiki; `tsrx-docs.ts` holds the one-sentence explanation of each TSRX
  token; `tsrx.tmLanguage.json` is the TSRX TextMate grammar. It is not called `plugins/` because
  Nitro claims that name for server plugins.

## Code blocks

Fenced code is highlighted at build time. `tooling/highlight-mdx.ts` finds the static HTML in the
module the router emits for each `.mdx` page, hands every `<pre><code class="language-…">` block to
shiki, and puts the result back, recounting the elements so the islands further down the page still
resume against the right nodes.

Supported fences: `tsrx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `js`, `json`, `css`, `sh`, `bash`, `html`. A fence in any
other language is left as plain `<pre><code>`.

Colours are not chosen by shiki. The theme is shiki's CSS-variable theme under a `--code-` prefix,
and every one of those variables is defined in `styles/global.css` from the site's paper tokens, so
the palette lives with the rest of the design.

In a `tsrx` fence, the TSRX constructs and the framework calls carry a hover doc: point at `@if`,
`state`, `attach` or an `onClick`-style prop, or tab to it, and one sentence explains it. The
sentences live in `tooling/tsrx-docs.ts`. There is no JavaScript behind them; the box is a child of
the token, shown by CSS on hover and on focus. `NOTES.md` section 9 says why it is not an island.

`NOTES.md` records what published 0.2.2 could and could not do while this was built. Read it before
changing the shell or the build config.
